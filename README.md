# spectare

(hopefully) pretty pictures with Clojure and Quil

So far there are three projects:

* paintdrops - Paintdrops fall towards the screen, increasing in size until
the splatter on impact
* parallel - Generates sets of parallel lines with color gradients
* sine - One (or more) circle(s) moves (or streaks) across the screen

## Usage

* lein deps
* lein run -m spectare.(paintdrops|parallel|sine)
